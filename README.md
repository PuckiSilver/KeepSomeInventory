# Keep Some Inventory

**Isn't it annoying when you die and your items are far away and surrounded by danger?**

With this data pack no longer, since you **keep your fighting equipment** like weapons, tools and armor **on you when dying**!

## Overview
**Personally I don't like** playing with the `keepInventory` gamerule set to `true` because it feels cheap to go somewhere dangerous **without the risk** of losing anything.
This data pack aims to give dangerous areas their **risk back** while still allowing you to **use your best equipment** that you spent hours on farming, crafting and enchanting.
